# table-cli
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Easily create your own table-base layout website.

They said table-base layout website was out of date. We said no. So now we are creating a brand new table-base layout website generator. It will totally blow your mind.

`table-cli` is in active development, PRs are welcome.

## Install
Use npm,

```
npm install -g table-cli
```

## Usage
Generate new table-base project:

```
table-cli new my-project
```

It will use the latest boilerplate to structure your project and the install all the dependencies for you, after that, just enter the project and start:

```
cd my-project
npm start
```

It will start a dev server on port 3000, see it in the browser: http://localhost:3000/
